# Coding Style Guide
These rules are meant as guidelines for writing C++ for FIRST Team 422. These
are not hard-and-fast rules; code should first and foremost be designed in a
logical manner. However, these guidelines allow consistency and readability to
be maintained across all of the robot's code. Do not break them without good
reason.

This document is modeled after the [Google Code C++ style guide]
(http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml).

## Header Files

### Guards
Every header file **must** be wrapped in a `#define` guard. These guards ought
to be named after the file they represent, e.g. a file named
"articulated_arm.hpp" should have a `#define` guard like this:

    #ifndef ARTICULATED_ARM_HPP
	#define ARTICULATED_ARM_HPP
	//Body of function
	#endif //ARTICULATED_ARM_HPP

Trailing comments, like the one in the example above, are recommended.

### `using namespace` Statements
Statements beginning with `using namespace` should never be used in header
files, as they pollute the global namespace. Instead, names should be referenced
by their full name, e.g. `std::vector`.

## Scoping

### Global Variables
Avoid using global variables and functions. Use methods and member variables of
classes when possible.

### Local Variables
Declare local variables at the top of their enclosing scope, that is, at the top
of the block in which they are declared. Initialize variables on declaration,
like this:

    int i = 0;

Rather than this:

    int i;
    i = 0;

If variables are used only once, for readability, make them `const`
and keep them directly above the line that they are used in.

## Classes

### Constructors

#### Initialization Lists
When assigning values to member variables in a constructor, use the
initialization list rather than the body of the constructor when possible. That
is, do this:

    Foo::Foo() :
    bar(0),
    baz(1) {
        //Initialize
    }

Rather than this:

    Foo::Foo() {
        bar = 0;
        baz = 1;
        //Initialize
    }

This method is both more efficient and the only valid method to initialize
constant member variables, so using it consistently helps prevent errors.

#### Default Constructors
Default constructors must be defined for all classes.

### Structs vs. Classes
Structs should be used only for containers for data, they must not have
methods. When in doubt, use a class.

### Encapsulation
Class members should be declared as `private` unless absolutely
necessary. Getters and setters should be used for changing member variables of
classes, rather than making the variables public. Getters and setters should be
named `get_variable_name()` and `set_variable_name( variable_type new_variable_name )`
respectively.

### Order of Declaration
`public` class members should be declared before `private` class members, and
variables should be declared before methods, e.g.

    class Foo {
        public:
            int i;
            bar();
        private:
            int j;
            baz();
    }

## Functions and Methods
Functions should be as short as possible. Functions ought to accomplish one and
only one task, and be descriptively named to fit that task, e.g. `raiseArm()`.

## Exceptions
Do not use exceptions, as they make control flow difficult to understand and
require extremely safe coding to avoid memory leaks.

## Casting
Use C++ style casting, i.e. `static_cast<int>(i)`, rather than C-style casting,
i.e. `(int)i`.

## Increment and Decrement
Use the prefix form of `++` and `--` whenever either form would be acceptable,
e.g. `++i;` rather than `i++;`

## Integer Types
Use only `int`, not `long`, `short`, or `unsigned`. If other integer types are
needed, use the consistent types from `<stdint.h>`, such as `int_32_t` or
`uint_64_t`.

## Preprocessor Macros
Avoid using preprocessor macros when possible.

## Values of Zero
Use 0 for integers and pointers, 0.0 for reals, and '\0' for chars.

## Constant Values
Constants should be declared as `const type name = value;`, rather than using
`#define`. This prevents unexpected behavior, for example when subtracting
negative constants.

## Naming
Use descriptive names, avoid abbreviations.

### File Names
File names should be in lower\_case.

### Type Names
Type names are in Title\_Case. This applies to classes, structs, enums, and all
other user-defined types.

### Variable Names
Variable names are in lower\_case. Additionally, boolean variables should imply
their type by beginning with "is" or "are", such as `is_robot_moving`.

### Constant Names
Constants should be named in UPPER\_CASE.

### Function Names
Functions should be in lower\_case, and usually should contain a verb in their
name, e.g. `move_forward()` not just `forward()`.

### Enums
Enums should be named in Title\_Case; enum values should be named in UPPER\_CASE.

### Macro Names
Macros should be named in UPPER\_CASE.

## Comments

### Multi-line Comments
Comments within the body of a method, function, and/or class should avoid using
the multi-line form. Instead, multiple-line comments should simply have `//` at
the beginning of each line.

## Formatting

### Line Length
Every line should be no more than 80 characters long.

### Whitespace
Tabs should be used for logical indentation, and spaces for alignment. This
prevents alignment from being distorted by different tab sizes.

### Curly Braces
Curly braces should open on the same line as the expression that requires a new
block. For example:

    int foo() {
        //function body
    }

Rather than:

    int foo()
    {
    //function body
    }

Conditional statements must always use curly braces, even when they only span
one line.

### Boolean Expressions
Boolean expressions spanning more than one line should have the joining operator
(either `||`or `&&`) at the beginning of each line, not the end.

### Parentheses
Parentheses should indicate order of operations in all expressions containing
more than one operator, even when technically unnecessary, e.g. `1 + ( 1 * 2 )`.

Parentheses used for grouping should have a space before and after their
contents.

### Classes
Access specifiers (`public`, `private`, and `protected`) should not be indented
with the body of the class.
